Steps to run:  
1. Run make.  
2. Run ./genrand <number_of_strings> <filename> [-a] - same as the previous submission. If number_of_strings is less than 10,000, it will be set to 10,000. The -a option appends the strings to the file; otherwise, it overwrites the file.  
3. Run ./encrypt <filename> - encrypts the file in batches of 100 lines each and writes the encrypted lines to the output directory.  

Verification:  
1. Inspect the output directory for the encrypted files. There should be a minimum of 100 files, each containing 100 lines of encrypted text (if the input file has 10,000 lines).  
2. Pick the first encrypted string from the first file in the output directory.  
3. Run ./cipher -d <encrypted_string>.  
4. Compare the result with the first string in the file generated using genrand.  
5. The output of step 3 should match the first string of the file generated by genrand.  
6. You may repeat the same for any random text of your choice. Be sure to match the deciphered string against the correct input string.  

Note: The output generated by step 3 will be in all uppercase letters.
